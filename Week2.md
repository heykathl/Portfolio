## Week 2

[Weekly outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/)

### Weekly goals

* Use all of week 1's skills 
* Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
* Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
* Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
* Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

#### This has been achieved through:

1. Creation of the [Oystercard](https://github.com/heykathl/oystercard) app: Demonstrated feature and unit testing, extracting class, mocking and completed as part of pair programming.
2. Attended Code Review and Process Workshops: Observing another person's coding process, and reviewing another person's code and spec files ([Airport Challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/airport_challenge/pull/2461)). Provide feedback including comments through GitHub.
3. Attended Doman Modelling Workshop: Illustrated Unified Markup Language (UML) Class Diagrams which provided a higher level thinking, than TDD. 
3. Attempt at the weekend [Takeaway Challenge](https://github.com/heykathl/takeaway-challenge) to view, select and confirm taekaway food orders: Demonstrated the use of a UML, TDD, encapsulation, SRP and debugging skills.
