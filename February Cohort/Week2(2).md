## Week 2 

[Weekly outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/)

### Weekly goals

* Use all of week 1's skills 
* Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
* Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
* Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
* Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

#### This has been achieved through:

1. Creation of the [Oystercard](https://github.com/heykathl/oystercard2) app: Demonstrated feature and unit testing, extracting classes, SRP,mocking and completed as part of pair programming.
2. Attended Code Review and Process Workshops: Observing another person's coding process, and reviewing another person's code and spec files ([Airport Challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/airport_challenge/pull/2485)). Provided meaningful feedback including comments through GitHub.
3. Attended Mocking and Isolation Workshop: Worked through the [Mocking 1](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/main/test_driven_development/mocking_1)exercises.
4. Attended Domain Modelling Workshop: Illustrated Unified Markup Language (UML) Class Diagrams which provided a higher level thinking, than TDD.

5. Attempt at the weekend [Takeaway Challenge](https://github.com/heykathl/takeaway-challenge) to view, select and confirm taekaway food orders: Demonstrated the use of a UML, TDD, SRP, encapsulation and debugging skills.
5. Explored [Test driving I](https://hackmd.io/NGdU2pqzSbOng3IwsDTzew): Learnt the basics of TDD
6. Completed a [Dice Game](https://github.com/heykathl/dice-game) which rolled multiple dices, to generate a random number 1 - 6 and returns the result: Demonstrated TDD and debugging skills.
7. Completed a [Checkout](https://github.com/heykathl/checkout) program which scans each item and calculates the price: Demonstrated TDD and debugging skills.
8. Completed a [Car Speed](https://github.com/heykathl/car-speed) exercise to describe a car's speed, acceleration and brake; and [Car Garage](https://github.com/heykathl/car-garage) exercise to add, find and remove cars based on the number plate and make: Demonstrated understanding of Classes and testing state and behaviour
