## Week 7

[Weekly outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/)

### Weekly goals

* Test-drive a simple Javascript program running in a web browser, using modern JS build tools.
* Use the DOM API to build a web user interface for this program.
* Build a single-page web application fetching and updating remote data using JS.

### This has been achieved through:
1. Creation of the [Notes](https://github.com/heykathl/notes-app) web page which stores and removes individual notes: Demonstrated TDD of a simple program in a web browser, use of the DOM API, fetching remote data and mocking APIs.
2. Attended the [Manipulating the DOM](https://github.com/makersacademy/javascript-web-applications/tree/main/workshops/manipulating-the-dom) workshop. Notes can be found [here](https://github.com/heykathl/Portfolio/blob/main/Evidence-and-Notes/DOM.md)
3. Attended the [Using fetch and Promises](https://github.com/makersacademy/javascript-web-applications/tree/main/workshops/promises) workshop. Notes can be found [here](https://github.com/heykathl/Portfolio/blob/main/Evidence-and-Notes/Fetch_and_promises.md)
4. Attempt at building the frontend of the [Chitter](https://github.com/heykathl/) application as part of the weekend challenge.
