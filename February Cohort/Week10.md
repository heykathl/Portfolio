## Week 10

[Weekly outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/)\
[Individual technical challenges](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/main/individual_challenges)

### Weekly goals

Ask yourself the same two questions:
* Are you having fun?
* Are you a better developer than you were yesterday?

By the end of the engineering project, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the primary question:
* Can you solve a challenging technical problem by writing well crafted code? By "well crafted code", we mean code that is well tested, easy to read and easy to change.
* Feel more confident in your ability to complete a tech test.
* Have developed a structured process to approaching complex problems, utilising TDD and good OO design skills.

### This has been achieved through:
* Completion of the [Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/heykathl/bank-tech-test).
* Attempt at the [Gilded Rose Tech Test](https://github.com/heykathl/gilded-rose-tech-test).
