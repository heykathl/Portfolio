## Week 4

[Weekly outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/)

### Weekly goals

* Build a simple web app with a database
* Follow an effective debugging process for database applications
* Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships between tables)

### Learning objectives
#### Agile & TDD
* Generate User Stories from Requirements
* Build a complete full-stack feature which includes the controller, model and database code

#### Engineering and 'Dev Recipes'
* Set up a Ruby web project which includes setting up Sinatra
* Use of SQL to attach a database to a web application
* Seperate application behaviour from database behaviour 
* Map objects across systems - specifically between class instance and database)
* Create a CRUD system in a database from a user-clickable web interface
* Implement a RESTful routing convention

#### Databases
* Install PostgreSQL to utilise psql in the terminal
* Create a database within the psql interface
* Implement a one-to-many relationship
* Use psql commands to interact with PostgreSQL, to add tables and records
* Use SQL query and CRUD terms (SELECT, FROM WHERE, *, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE etc.)
* Implement a many-many relationship

#### Tooling
* Set up a test environment 
* Use database GUIs to interact with databases

#### Skills
* Test-drive advanced Objects in Ruby, including adapter, wrapper and service objects
* Use a step-by-step approach to pull logic from concretes to abstractions

### This has been achieved through:

1. Creation of the [Bookmark Manager](https://github.com/heykathl/bookmark_manager) web application: Demonstrated get/post requests, HTML and CSS, debugging web applications, an understanding of the MVC pattern, use of SQL and databases, completed as part of pair programming.
2. Completed a Code Review: Reviewing another person's code and test files ([Rock Paper Scissors Challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/rps-challenge/pull/2075). Provided feedback including comments through GitHub.
3. Attended the Database modelling workshop: Modelled out databases and its different types of relationships.
4. Creation of a [Chitter](https://github.com/heykathl/ ) web application as part of the weekend challenge: Demonstrated get/post requests, HTML and CSS, debugging web applications, an understanding of the MVC pattern, and use of SQL and databases.
