## Week 11 and 12

[Weekly outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/)

### Weekly goals

Ask yourself the same two questions:
* Are you having fun?
* Are you a better developer than you were yesterday?

By the end of the engineering project, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the primary question:
* Can you use high-quality processes to build an extended project in a team?
* [Detailed learning objectives](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/practice_project_week/learning_objectives.md) 

### This has been achieved through:
Completion of [Travel Angel](https://github.com/adamwoodcock98/travel-angel) web application, which allows users to upload travel documents. 
- This is the [video demo](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VEHu_mx9KQAjgv8b3rXEUj4ChEIE8IlI) of our project. 
- This is the [video presentation](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SfiZUCQykAcw-rN8Q4ZvYfgoGyPWGTRy) of our project on demo day.

The following learning objectives have been met throughout the process of working on Travel Angel: 

- As identified in our [Team Charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sjqER8Ke5tpUqPo-N0Zb0VVEmAJgFuZq_C0V_8IxtPQ/edit), we followed agile methodologies to keep ourselves and the project on track.
- We planned our project by [mindmapping](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VEHu_mx9KQAjgv8b3rXEUj4ChEIE8IlI), identifying our MVP, 'should have' features and 'nice to have' features. 
- We developed a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/4lVhb0fA/travel-angel) to manage our workflow.
- We developed a total of 20 user stories, found in our [Team Charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sjqER8Ke5tpUqPo-N0Zb0VVEmAJgFuZq_C0V_8IxtPQ/edit). 
- In addition to the Trelloboard, we created issues on GitHub and linked it with each pull request that was uploaded to the repository. 
- We had bi-daily standups which have been documented [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jRreo6EQU1EZucqIzjM7kLfe2wypYp_G) and a retrospective at the end of each day. This ensures that every member is aware of the tasks and the deadlines they're required to complete it by.

### Daily Goals
Due to the nature and scale of this final group project, I did not set daily goals for myself.
