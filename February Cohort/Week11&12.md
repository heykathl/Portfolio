## Week 11 and 12

[Weekly outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/)

### Weekly goals

Ask yourself the same two questions:
* Are you having fun?
* Are you a better developer than you were yesterday?

By the end of the engineering project, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the primary question:
* Can you use high-quality processes to build an extended project in a team?
Production code is generally built by a team of developers. It is important that you leave Makers with the skills needed to work in a team, and this is the primary reason that project weeks exist in the curriculum.
* [Detailed learning objectives](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/practice_project_week/learning_objectives.md)

### This has been achieved through:
* Completion of [Travel Angel](https://github.com/adamwoodcock98/travel-angel) web application, which allows users to upload travel documents. This website is hosted on Heroku and can be viewed here: [Travel Angel](travel-angel.herokuapp.com)

### Daily Goals
Due to the nature and scale of this final group project, I did not set daily goals for myself.
