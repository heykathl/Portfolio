## Week 6

[Weekly outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/)

### Weekly goals

* Test-drive a simple Javascript program using Node.
* Explain how asynchronous programming is different from synchronous, blocking
  programming.
* Apply a coherent process to learn a new language.

### This has been achieved through:
1. Worked through the [Fundamentals of Javscript](https://github.com/heykathl/javascript-fundamentals): Applied a cohorent process to learn a new language and demonstrated understanding of asynchronous programming.
2. Attended the [Javascript Debugging](https://github.com/makersacademy/javascript-fundamentals/tree/main/workshops/debugging) workshop.
3. Built a [Thermostat](https://github.com/heykathl/thermostat) and [Shopping Basket](https://github.com/heykathl/shopping-basket.git) program: Test-drove a simple Javascript program using Node.
3. Attempt at the [Bowling](https://github.com/heykathl/bowling-challenge) application as part of the weekend challenge in Javascript.
