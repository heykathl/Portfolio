## Week 1

[Weekly outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/)

### Weekly goals

* Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
* Pair using the driver-navigator style
* Follow an effective debugging process
* Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

#### This has been achieved through:

1. Creation of the [Boris Bike](https://github.com/heykathl/boris-bikes2) app: Demonstrated feature and unit testing (TDD), encapsulation, SRP and first part completed as part of pair programming.
2. Attended TDD Workshop: Creation of a [Piggy Bank](https://github.com/heykathl/piggy_bank) program which deposited, checked and withdrew funds
3. Attended Debugging Workshop: Completed a debugging exercises [FizzBuzz & Cipher](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/main/test_driven_development/debugging_fizzbuzz)
4. Attempt at the weekend [Airport Challenge](https://github.com/heykathl/airport_challenge) which instruct planes to land and takeoff from an airport: Demonstrated TDD, encapsulation, SRP and debugging skills
5. Explored [Test driving I](https://hackmd.io/NGdU2pqzSbOng3IwsDTzew): Learnt the basics of TDD
6. Completed a [Dice Game](https://github.com/heykathl/dice-game) which rolled multiple dices, to generate a random number 1 - 6 and returns the result: Demonstrated TDD and debugging skills.
7. Completed a [Checkout](https://github.com/heykathl/checkout) program which scans each item and calculates the price: Demonstrated TDD and debugging skills.
8. Completed a [Car Speed](https://github.com/heykathl/car-speed) exercise to describe a car's speed, acceleration and brake; and [Car Garage](https://github.com/heykathl/car-garage) exercise to add, find and remove cars based on the number plate and make: Demonstrated understanding of Classes and testing state and behaviour
